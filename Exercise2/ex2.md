### 1. Visualization
The last visualization is a circular of the characters with some sub-groups spread out to the sides. You can see the names of everybody but because of the overlap of edges the relations or groups are not visible. Even some labels are overlapping.

### 2. Visualization
This visualization clusters the node in a way, that you can see the different networks. You can still clearly see Valjean since he has so many connections, but other influential figures stand out more clearly compared to the first visualization. This is also improved by the different sizes of nodes, depending on the number of edges. However, the bend edges make it hard to follow the connections. Also the network does not look very organic and there still seams to be some forced positions that make the networks less obvious.

### 3. Visualization
The third visualization is a forced directed layout of the graph. It has labels and different sizes of nodes and even nodes different colors. This makes it very clear who belongs to what and how they are connected. The empty space could be reduced by lowering the repulsive forces or by increasing the size of the nodes. This would improve the legibility.


### 4. Visualization
The last visualization is a hierarchical view of the characters and their relationships. Valjean, the main character, is at the top and everyone else below, depending on how close they are to him. This is supposed to show how close everyone is to Valjean. The type of visualization is chosen well to show this, but the connections blend into each other and the labels are not visible.


## Improvements
I chose to improve third network because it did not need that much to get more valuable. I increased the minimum size of nodes and applied another force directed layout. The layout became tighter and easier to follow.

### B:
For the layout I first used the tree layout. After this, the right part next to 'Daniel' where not moved because the structure is not a tree. For those nodes I adjusted the position manually. I wanted a compact network without overlapping edges.

### C:
In and out degree are special properties of nodes in directed graph. The in degree specifies how many edges are pointed towards the node, while the out degree specifies how many edges start at the node. They can be an indication of popularity and influence.
